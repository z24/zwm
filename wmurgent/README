To compile wmurgent, you have to install the X11 library. In some distributions,
you may need to install libX11-dev package.

After `make`, you will get the execute file: wmurgent. Copy it to any folder
listed in your PATH.

To integrate irssi-dwm.pl with your irssi:
`cp irssi-dwm.pl ~/.irssi/scripts/`
`mkdir ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/`
`ln -s ~/.irssi/scripts/irssi-dwm.pl ~/.irssi/scripts/autorun/`

Then start irssi with `irssi.sh`
