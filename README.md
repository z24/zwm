# About #

zwm is another dwm-based Window Manager. This WM is 100% customized to
my own habits. As I'm not a weird guy, so you may agree with those new
features as well. Detailed usage can be found in 'changelog'.

# Features #

- move window (float mode) around using keyboard as in evilwm
- transparent status bar by default
- xft font support
- each tag has its own window layout
